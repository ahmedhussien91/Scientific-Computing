# Scientific-Computing
This repo mainly contain the solution for a course of scientific compution

proj_1 => 3 parts that is impelemented using a C++ class library for 
Part One
implemented subroutines for solution of linear system of equations: Gauss
elimination with scaled partial pivoting AND Gauss-Seidel. Used BOTH methods in the other
two parts described below when applicable AND compare both methods in terms of (1)
accuracy, (2) criteria for convergence, and (3) computational costs.
Part Two
implemented subroutines for linear and polynomial regressions (check course
notes). You will be given three sample datasets and you should report the fitted models for
all of them and plot the fitted models with input points simultaneously.
Part Three
implemented subroutines for Newton’s and cubic spline interpolations (check
course notes). You will be given four sample datasets representing some paths for a robot in
(x, y) coordinates and you need to increase the number of points along the path 2X, 4X and
8X. The new points should lay on your fitted curve for each path. You should also plot the
original and new points using Newton and cubic spline separately for each path.

proj_2 => 
Enhance a cloth simulator that is based on mass-spring model by adding improved
integrators. The basic simulator program with two integrators, Euler and Midpoint, is
provided. reimpelemnt the same simulation with integrators based on: (1) Heun’s method with iterations
(propose stopping criteria), (2) Runge-Kutta order 4, and (3) Adaptive RK methods with step
halving.

proj_3 =>
